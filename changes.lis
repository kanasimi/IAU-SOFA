 Revisions

 1) An error in the C version of the DAT routine was corrected. The error, not 
    present in the Fortran version, applied only to dates in the first half of 
    1972. The consequences were platform-dependent; in the test environment the
    error left the results unaffected, but with other compilers and computers, 
    wrong answers or even arithmetical exceptions were possible.

 1) A bug affecting the routines iauFk52h and iauH2fk5 has been corrected. This
    caused erroneous proper motions (and also radial velocity) to be returned.
 
 2) The testbed t_sofa_c.c has been updated to reflect the changes to iauFk52h 
    and iauH2fk5.

 3) In the C header file sofa.h, an used reference has been removed.

 4) In the C functions iauFk5hip, iauGmst00, iauObl80 and iauObl06, use of the 
    ANSI C language feature "unary plus" has been eliminated, to avoid 
    difficulties with older compilers.

1) An error in the description of the coordinates of the Celestial Intermediate
   Pole with respect to the International Terrestrial Reference System in the 
   routines iauC2t00a, iauC2t00b, iauC2t06a, iauC2tpe, iauC2txy and iauPom00 
   has been corrected. These revisions have no effect on the results produced 
   by these routines.
